# Scenario
You are a Quality Control Specialist tasked with ensuring the quality of chemical batches. Everyday, you are given a batch of chemical products to vet. 
Defective chemicals usually differ from quality goods by weight. To this end, you are given a highly sensitive balancing scale to help you with your job.  

However, each use of the balancing scale is costly and company policy limits its use to 3 uses each day.  

Your role is to use this balancing scale to identify and dispose of the defective chemicals. You will be rewarded based on the number of quality goods you ship each day.
However, there are also heavy penalties for mistakes. You will be penalised for shipping defective goods by accident or wasting quality goods.  

Good luck!

PS: Currently, there is no end to this game (it can go on for infinite days), please stop at your own pace.

# Guidelines
- Of 8/10/12 chemical products, you have to identify and dispose of the defects
- Defective chemicals differ from quality goods by weight. They can be **either heavier or lighter** than quality goods
- Weigh the chemicals against each other using the balancing scale to identify the defects
- You can move the chemicals around by selecting them and clicking on or dragging to the target destination (you can also select multiple chemicals at one time)
- You are limited in the times you can use the balance scale each day. The number of uses you are allowed will be made known to you
- To use the balancing scale, click on **Activate** after placing the chemicals on the scale
- You can also restore the chemicals and balancing scale to their original positions by clicking **Reset** (this step is not necessary to activate the balancing scale again)
- After identifying the defects, move them into the **biohazard bin**
- When you are ready to ship the quality goods, click **Ship!**. All chemicals outside the biohazard bin will automatically be shipped out
- After shipping, the defective chemicals will be revealed to you (they will be highlighted in purple) 
- Subsequently, a new day will begin with a fresh batch of chemicals for checking
